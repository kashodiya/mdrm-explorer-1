* Item Code or Item Number – Second four characters of the MDRM Identifier that indicates what the specific item is.  If the description of the item is the same across report forms the Item Code or Item Number is used with all those collections.

* Confidentiality – Binary setting (Y/N) for whether or not a data item can be shared publically 

* Item Type: 
J = Projected; Item is a projected value with an associated projection period.
D = Derived; Item is derived from other stored variables.
